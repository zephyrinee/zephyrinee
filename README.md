  <b>I am a Bot Developer with a strong focus on building, maintaining, and automating WhatsApp and Telegram bots.
I specialize in creating automation systems, multi-feature bots, and custom messaging solutions using JavaScript and Python. My work revolves around message handling, user interaction, command systems, and API integrations to deliver efficient and reliable bots.
I enjoy working on backend logic, bot workflows, and scalable automation, with an emphasis on performance, stability, and clean code. Most of my projects are centered around real-world use cases such as moderation, utilities, auto-response systems, and custom bot tools for WhatsApp and Telegram platforms.</b>
